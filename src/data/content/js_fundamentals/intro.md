JavaScript lets us orchestrate UX flows, wire APIs and plug in geo libraries such as OpenLayers or Masterportal widgets. In this lesson you will:

- Revisit execution models (call stack, heap, task queue)
- Practice authoring modern syntax (modules, async/await, destructuring)
- Learn how we document code samples for juniors

Take a few minutes to journal the parts of JS that still feel fuzzy to you—this helps mentors guide your next steps.
