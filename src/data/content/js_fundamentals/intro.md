JavaScript is the foundation of everything we build. It powers our user interfaces, connects backend services, and integrates specialized geo libraries like OpenLayers and Masterportal. Without a solid grasp of JavaScript fundamentals, you won't be able to understand how our applications work or contribute effectively to the codebase.

## Why JavaScript Matters

Modern web applications are interactive, data-driven, and real-time. JavaScript makes this possible by running directly in the browser, handling user interactions, managing application state, and communicating with servers. In our geo applications, JavaScript orchestrates map rendering, layer management, feature selection, and coordinate transformations.

## What You Need to Know

You should be comfortable with:

- **Core language concepts** — variables, functions, objects, arrays, and control flow
- **Asynchronous programming** — promises, async/await, and handling API responses
- **Modern syntax** — ES modules, destructuring, arrow functions, and template literals
- **DOM manipulation** — selecting elements, updating content, and handling events
- **Error handling** — try/catch blocks and defensive coding practices

These fundamentals appear everywhere in our codebase. Whether you're building a Vue component, configuring a Masterportal widget, or processing WFS responses, you'll rely on these JavaScript concepts daily.

## Learning Path

Start by reviewing the basics if anything feels unclear. The external resources linked in upcoming lessons provide comprehensive coverage of JavaScript mechanics. Focus on understanding over memorization — you'll get plenty of practice applying these concepts in real projects.

Take time to identify gaps in your knowledge early. If async/await confuses you, or if you're unsure how modules work, flag it now. Your mentors can guide you through the tricky parts before they become blockers on actual tasks.
