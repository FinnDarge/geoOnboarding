# Capstone brief: Masterportal

Build a compact Masterportal application that stitches together at least two WMS layers, one WFS feed, and a custom widget.

**Must-haves**

- A themed UI with at least one bespoke control (e.g., bookmark, layer toggle, or legend tweak)
- Layer configuration pulled from the Masterportal repo so your setup mirrors production structure
- Tests that cover the bespoke control and a happy-path integration of the data layers

Your mentor will review code readability, layer configuration hygiene, and the clarity of your README.
