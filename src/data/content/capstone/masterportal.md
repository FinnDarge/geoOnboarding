Design a Masterportal experience that mirrors a small municipal deployment.

**Deliverable**
- A Vue-powered UI that toggles at least two Masterportal layers and surfaces attribution.
- A concise configuration change log explaining which layer settings you touched and why.
- A short Mocha/Chai suite that guards the most critical store interactions.

Present the capstone with a 2–3 minute walkthrough explaining how citizens would use the portal.
