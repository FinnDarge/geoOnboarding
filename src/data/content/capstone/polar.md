# Capstone brief: Polar

Deliver a polar-focused viewer that blends ice, snow, and vessel context for one pole.

**Must-haves**

- At least one polar-stereographic basemap plus an ice concentration layer sourced from the onboarding repo configs
- A time slider or date picker that refreshes the ice layer and documents how timestamps are derived
- A station or vessel overlay with hover/selection that surfaces key attributes for field teams

Your mentor will review projection choices, responsiveness, and how well you document data provenance in the README.
