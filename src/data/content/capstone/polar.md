Ship a focused Polar demo that proves you can configure data feeds and interactions end-to-end.

**Deliverable**
- A Polar map with one vector source and one tiled source configured from the repo docs.
- A user interaction (search, filter, or toggle) that demonstrates the configured layers.
- A handful of regression tests or checklists showing how you'll prevent broken deployments.

Record a quick demo or write a README that explains how to run and validate your Polar setup.
