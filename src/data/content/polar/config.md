Bring a Polar instance online by wiring data sources and configuration in the repository.
Start with a small layer set and grow it as you validate the experience.

**What to practice**
- Add a GeoJSON feed with sensible attribution and style definitions.
- Configure a WMTS or WMS layer and confirm it renders alongside your vector data.
- Expose a search or filtering control so stakeholders can see how Polar behaves with real input.

Keep your commits scoped: configuration changes should live near the docs you reference so reviewers
can follow the breadcrumbs back into the GitHub repo.
