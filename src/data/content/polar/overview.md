# Polar data overview

This lesson summarizes the core datasets and projection considerations used in the polar track. Review how polar stereographic projections differ from common web mercator maps, and note which services expose near-real-time ice and snow products.

Key resources to explore:

- ESA Climate Change Initiative for sea ice products
- NSIDC data catalogs for passive microwave records
- Sentinel-1 SAR open data for sea ice dynamics

When you feel comfortable with the basic vocabulary and can explain the difference between Arctic and Antarctic projections, mark this lesson complete.
