# Polar data landscape

Polar mapping work leans heavily on cryosphere programs that publish open data. Start by reviewing the repos and docs we use to stage layers:

- The [PGC inputs repo](https://github.com/PolarGeospatialCenter/pgc-inputs) that catalogs Arctic and Antarctic vector/imagery sources
- The [NSIDC data catalogs](https://nsidc.org/data) for passive microwave and snow products
- Sea ice dashboards such as [Uni Bremen](https://seaice.uni-bremen.de/) for near-real-time ice concentration

Cross-check these resources against the projections and services you will consume later in the track. When you can describe which feeds are used for operational versus research views and which layers require reprojection, mark this lesson complete.
